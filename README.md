# Flight Delay Prediction Model

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook outlines the process of building a machine learning model aimed at predicting flight delays. The project utilizes historical flight data, focusing on various factors that could influence delays, such as weather conditions, departure times, and airline efficiency. 
This was undertaken as part of the Zindi Flight Prediction challenge, for the capstone project of the initial AI/ML Refactory cohort, by the AUTOBOTS team. 

## Contents
1. **Introduction:** Brief overview of the project's objectives and the importance of predicting flight delays.
2. **Data Collection:** Description of the data sources and the methodology used to gather the flight data.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values and data normalization.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visual and statistical analysis to understand the data better and identify patterns or anomalies.
5. **Feature Engineering:** Process of selecting, modifying, or creating new features that are most relevant to the prediction target.
6. **Model Selection:** Evaluation of different machine learning algorithms to find the most suitable model for predicting flight delays.
7. **Model Training:** Detailed explanation of how the model is trained, including the selection of hyperparameters and training techniques.
8. **Model Evaluation:** Assessment of the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE score.
9. **Deployment:** Guidelines on how to deploy the model for real-time predictions, including any required environment setup.
10. **Conclusion:** Summary of the findings, model performance, and potential areas for future work.

## Getting Started
To run this notebook, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and the following Python libraries:
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation

alternatively, this notebook can be run via google colab.

## Data
The dataset includes features such as flight date, scheduled departure and arrival times, actual departure and arrival times, airline information, weather conditions, and airport traffic. The target variable is the flight delay status (delayed or on-time). The dataset used was provided by Zindi for the Flight prediction challenge.
